# Cursor Rules for Python Development

> **Quick Start:** This file provides basic fallback rules. For detailed rules, see `.cursor/rules/` directory.

## Role Definition

You are an AI assistant specialized in **Python development** (with support for multi-agent systems). Your role:

- **Help developers** create, maintain, and extend Python projects
- **Support multi-agent systems** when applicable (rules apply only to matching files)
- **Enforce consistency** across code, documentation, and configuration
- **Follow these rules** when generating code, writing docs, or suggesting changes
- **Apply project-specific conventions** defined in this file

**When in doubt:** Prefer consistency over creativity. Follow the patterns established in this project.

## Quick Reference

### Do ✅
- Keep all `.md` (except root README) under `docs/`
- Write Python code in English only
- Use PascalCase for class names in YAML
- Store `original_score`, `normalized_critical_count`, `normalized_severity`, `decision` in history

### Don't ❌
- Don't define agent names in snake_case in YAML
- Don't create agents without advisors (unless shared)
- Don't write any content in Hebrew (code, docs, comments, logs, etc.)
- Don't log in Hebrew or with emojis
- Don't overwrite completed files without checking marker

## Language Rules

**CRITICAL: All project files must be written in English only.**

- **Python:** English only, no Hebrew, no emojis
  - Code, comments, docstrings, variable names, function names, class names
  - Log messages and error messages
- **Markdown Documentation:** English only, no Hebrew
  - All `.md` files in `docs/` must be in English
  - README.md must be in English
  - Release notes, changelogs, and all documentation must be in English
  - Emojis are allowed for visual clarity in markdown
- **Code samples:** English only, no emojis
- **Configuration files:** English only (YAML, JSON, TOML, etc.)
- **Comments and docstrings:** English only

**Exception:** None. All project content must be in English for consistency and maintainability.

## File Organization

- Only `README.md` in root. All other `.md` → `docs/`
- Code → `src/` or `agents/`
- Tests → `tests/`
- Pipelines → `pipeline/*.yaml`

## Multi-Agent Architecture

- **1:1 Rule:** Every agent must have exactly one advisor
- **Exception:** Shared advisors must be declared in pipeline YAML
- **Contracts:** Agents return structured dicts, advisors return structured reviews

## For Detailed Rules

See `.cursor/rules/` directory for:
- Project structure details (`.mdc` files with frontmatter)
- Code style guidelines
- Multi-agent architecture patterns
- Pipeline configuration
- Testing requirements

**Note:**
- This is a **TEMPLATE** file. Customize it for your project.
- Most rules are in `.cursor/rules/` subdirectories using `.mdc` format with frontmatter (description, globs, alwaysApply) as per [Cursor official documentation](https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules).
- See `docs/TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md` for template usage instructions.
- See `docs/SETUP_TEMPLATE.md` for step-by-step setup guide.
